journeyplanner
==============

An innovative way of accomplishing journey planning with Megabus [Utilizing many algorithms from busapp]

<h1>Application</h1>
<p>journeyplanner is the backend for a frontend <a href="http://www.megabusfinder.appspot.com">Here</a>
The application accomplishes extensible travel search capabilities for any desired route through
a large travel company called <a href="http://us.megabus.com">megabus</a>.  The problem with
<b>megabus</b> is that they have all sorts of stops, nodes, that travel to each other, but they
only allow for the use to plan a trip from one node to it's first degree connections nodes.  An example
of this is trying to book travel from St. Louis, MO to Milwaukee, WI.  The closest first degree node
that St. Louis, MO has to Milwaukee, WI is Chicago, IL.  I as a user must book, and plan this trip from
St. Louis, MO to Chicago, IL in accordance with trips from Chicago, IL to Milwaukee, IL via a means of multiple
tabs and all sorts of ugly stuff like that.  On <a href="http://www.megabusfinder.appspot.com">my app</a>, however,
you can simply fill the form with St. Louis, MO and Milwaukee, WI as departure and arrival cities, respectively, and 
let the app do all the trip planning for you.  Check it out!
