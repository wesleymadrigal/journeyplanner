journeyplanner
==============

An innovative way of accomplishing journey planning with Megabus [Utilizing many algorithms from busapp]

<h1>Application</h1>
<p>journeyplanner is the backend for a frontend:<br><tr> <a href="http://www.megabusfinder.appspot.com">Here</a>

The application accomplishes extensible travel search capabilities for any desired route through
a large travel company called <a href="http://us.megabus.com">megabus</a>.  
</p>
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>
<b>megabus</b> has all sorts of stops, nodes, that travel to each other, but they
only allow for the use to plan a trip from <b>one</b> node to it's <b>first degree</b> connections nodes.  
</p>
<h1>
An example
</h1>
<p> I'm trying to book travel from St. Louis, MO to Milwaukee, WI.  The closest first degree node
that St. Louis, MO has to Milwaukee, WI is Chicago, IL.  I as a user must book, and plan this trip from
St. Louis, MO to Chicago, IL in accordance with trips from Chicago, IL to Milwaukee, IL via a means of multiple
tabs and all sorts of ugly stuff like that.  
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://www.megabusfinder.appspot.com"><b>my app</b></a><br>
You can simply fill the form with St. Louis, MO and Milwaukee, WI as departure and arrival cities, respectively, and 
let the app do all the trip planning for you.  These cities are abitrary and the app works to connect any two cities
that megabus services via this user-friendly method.</p>
